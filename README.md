Email-Filter
============

This program will find all valid emails from a file you give it and output
the results to a designated output file.  This program was developed as 
part of my final project in my C++ class.

I used C++ <deque> collections to store the valid emails I found from test
files.  I made sure there were no duplicates.  You can essentially use this program
to clean out text files (such as HTML).  I've listed the output to separate the
emails by semicolon.  The output file contents can be copied to a "TO/CC/BCC"
field should you wish to email everyone (would be best to use the BCC to protect
privacy of course).

I've marked up the file so it's easier to understand what's going.  If you have
any question, please feel free to email me anytime.
